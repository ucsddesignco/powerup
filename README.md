# Power Up

Power Up is a 10-week summer design program that prepares UCSD students for real-world innovation by pairing student teams with BIPOC-owned and minority-owned businesses seeking to refine their branding, redesign their website, or boost their exposure. Each team will receive guidance from industry mentors as they craft sustainable designs and deliverables thatâ€™ll live beyond the scope of the project.

Our program is driven by our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiative, which is intended to support BIPOC communities and give design students more opportunities to develop their skills.
