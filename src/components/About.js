                    Power Up is a 10-week summer design program that prepares 
                    UCSD students for real-world innovation by pairing student 
                    teams with BIPOC-owned and minority-owned businesses seeking 
                    to refine their branding, redesign their website, or boost 
                    their exposure. Each team will receive guidance from industry 
                    mentors as they craft sustainable designs and deliverables 
                    thatâ€™ll live beyond the scope of the project. <br /> <br />

                    Our program is driven by our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
                    initiative, which is intended to support BIPOC communities and 
                    give underrepresented design students more opportunities to 
                    develop their skills.
