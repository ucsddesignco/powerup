      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    content="Power Up is a 10-week summer design program that prepares UCSD students for real-world innovation by pairing student teams with BIPOC-owned and minority-owned businesses seeking to refine their branding, redesign their website, or boost their exposure. Each team will receive guidance from industry mentors as they craft sustainable designs and deliverables that’ll live beyond the scope of the project.

    Our program is driven by our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiative, which is intended to support BIPOC communities and give design students more opportunities to develop their skills." />
